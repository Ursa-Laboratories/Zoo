# Zoo Windows Installer

This directory builds a Windows installer for an operator-facing Zoo runtime.
The installer is intentionally local and self-contained: it installs a private
Python runtime, installs Zoo/CubOS packages from an offline wheelhouse, copies
the checked-out Zoo and CubOS `main` sources into the app directory, launches
Zoo from the copied Zoo source so the prebuilt frontend is available, and seeds
the operator config folder from CubOS configs on first launch.

## What The Installer Targets

- Zoo repo: `https://github.com/Ursa-Laboratories/Zoo.git`, branch `main`
- CubOS repo: `https://github.com/Ursa-Laboratories/CubOS.git`, branch `main`
- Runtime: app-local Python 3.11
- User config directory: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UrsaLabs\Zoo\configs`
- Logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UrsaLabs\Zoo\logs`

The generated installer does not require Python, Node.js, Git, or internet
access on the operator machine.

## Packaging Machine Requirements

Run the build on a Windows x64 machine with:

- Git
- Python 3.11
- Node.js/npm compatible with the frontend lockfile
- Inno Setup 6
- Internet access for cloning repos, downloading wheels, and downloading the
  Python installer

## Build

From the Zoo checkout:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\installer\windows\build-installer.ps1
```

The output is written under:

```text
installer\windows\build\dist\
```

The same build can be run from GitHub Actions through the `Windows Installer`
workflow. The workflow builds on `windows-latest` and uploads the generated
installer as the `zoo-windows-installer` artifact. It runs on pull requests
that touch the installer/runtime surface. Every push to `main` builds the
installer, assigns an automatic version `0.1.<workflow run number>`, and
publishes the `.exe` to a GitHub Release tagged `v0.1.<workflow run number>`.

Useful overrides:

```powershell
.\installer\windows\build-installer.ps1 `
  -ZooRepoUrl https://github.com/Ursa-Laboratories/Zoo.git `
  -CubOSRepoUrl https://github.com/Ursa-Laboratories/CubOS.git `
  -Branch main `
  -AppVersion 0.1.123 `
  -BuildPythonPath "C:\Python311\python.exe" `
  -PythonVersion 3.11.9 `
  -InnoCompiler "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe"
```

When the script runs in GitHub Actions, the workflow passes
`-ZooSourceDir "$env:GITHUB_WORKSPACE"` so the installer is built from the
checked-out Zoo commit. CubOS is still cloned from `main`.

## Operator Shortcuts

The installer creates Start Menu shortcuts for:

- `Start Zoo`
- `Zoo Configs`
- `Zoo Logs`
- `Export Diagnostics`

`Start Zoo` binds to `127.0.0.1:8742`, opens the browser, and writes a log file.
On first launch, if the user config directory has no YAML files, the launcher
copies the bundled CubOS configs into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UrsaLabs\Zoo\configs`.

## Validation Checklist

Before handing the installer to an operator:

1. Build the installer on a clean Windows packaging machine.
2. Install it on a clean Windows test VM with no Python, Node.js, or Git on
   `PATH`.
3. Launch `Start Zoo` and confirm `http://127.0.0.1:8742` opens.
4. Confirm `%LOCALAPPDATA%\UrsaLabs\Zoo\configs` contains seeded CubOS config
   YAMLs.
5. Confirm the gantry and ASMI hardware are not connected during UI-only smoke
   testing, or keep the machine clear and E-stop reachable during hardware
   tests.
6. Use `Export Diagnostics` and verify the zip includes build info, logs,
   configs, and Python package information.

Hardware-touching actions such as connect, home, jog, calibration, and protocol
runs still require normal lab clearance.
